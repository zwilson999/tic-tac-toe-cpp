# Tic-tac-toe
This is my first project in c++, and the goal is simply to construct a tic-tac-toe game where the client (user) plays tic-tac-toe vs the computer, which randomly chooses where it picks its mark.

The user chooses whether they want to be X or O and the computer will be given the non-chosen option. 

A victory is decided when either the player or the computer has three of their assigned symbol in a row (there are 8 possible ways to win tic-tac-toe on a standard 3x3 board).

### Compiling (Makefile)
```make build```

### Running
```make run```
